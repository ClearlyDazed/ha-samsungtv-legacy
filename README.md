Home Assistant Integration for legacy Samsung TV.

The samsungtv platform allows you to control a legacy Samsung Smart TV. In my case a Series F (2013) TV.

Setup
Download thes files (less the Readme) into a directory named legacy_samsungtv under the custom components directory.
The installation depends on your TV being on and SSDP discovery is enabled. The configuration only uses SSDP and there is no need for adding anything to the configuration YAML file. Wait for the notification and confirm the detected device.

If your TV is first connected, you will need to accept Home Assistant on the TV to allow communication.
